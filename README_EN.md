# GenshinRepository
This repository includes direct links to Genshin Impact updates. With this, it allows you to download Genshin Impact updates without a launcher, but using a download manager (like IDM, FDM, XDM, uGet, etc.).

Thank you for entrusting this repository to download Genshin Impact data directly. With a heavy heart, I have to stop this for personal reasons. But don't worry; I'm sure you can do it yourself. Once again, thank you for trusting this repository.

## Continue Maintaining For GenshinRepository

Because the previous repository has been archived by the owner and unmaintained, I will continue to maintain and provide updates on Genshin Impact data. Thanks so much to @RapDodge for providing this repository.

## Genshin Daily Fetch Automation (Genshin-Repository-List)

I've created a new repository to automate fetching data and saving files daily. The repository retrieves data from the same API URL as this repository. You can visit my repository at the following link. Thanks for visiting my repository.
